# Google Prompting Essentials

Some popular delimiters include:

- **Triple quotes ("""):**
  These create a distinction between the different elements of the prompt, like your task and context.
  They’re useful for when you want to clearly separate text within a prompt to signify different meanings, purposes, or other distinguishers.

- **XML tags:**
  These are like labels that mark different sections of more complex prompts.
  For example, add “<task>” to make it super clear where your task begins and “</task>" to indicate where it ends.

- **Markdown tags:**
  These are symbols you can use in prompts to add formatting.
  For example, if you were to use a gen AI tool to copy-edit your work, you could surround text with “\_” to italicize it or “\*\*” to bold it.
  This preserves your formatting as you move it into a gen AI tool, which generally uses plain, or unformatted text.

### Generate better outputs through iteration

- **Revisit the prompting framework:**
  Make sure your prompt is clear about your desired task and includes a specific persona and format, plenty of context, and offers relevant references that help inform the output.

- **Break the prompt into shorter sentences:**
  Instead of packing everything into a complex and lengthy prompt, address each individual step in a separate prompt until you’ve accomplished everything.

- **Introduce constraints:**
  Focus the gen AI tool’s output by adding constraints, or limitations, to your prompt.
  When you set boundaries for specific categories, lengths, formats, or other details in your prompt,
  you help the tool provide a more precise output.
  It’s like asking for a list of food recipes but specifying that the recipe should only use seasonal ingredients and take less than 30 minutes to prepare.
  Adding constraints can actually encourage more inventive, targeted results that better match your needs.

- **Tweak your phrasing or switch to an analogous task:**
  Shift your language to explain what you mean in a different way.
  Or, try a different task that’s similar to what you’re trying to complete but different enough to trigger a new response.
