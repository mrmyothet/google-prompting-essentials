# Google Prompting Essentials

Some popular delimiters include:

- **Triple quotes ("""):**
  These create a distinction between the different elements of the prompt, like your task and context.
  They’re useful for when you want to clearly separate text within a prompt to signify different meanings, purposes, or other distinguishers.

- **XML tags:**
  These are like labels that mark different sections of more complex prompts.
  For example, add “<task>” to make it super clear where your task begins and “</task>" to indicate where it ends.

- **Markdown tags:**
  These are symbols you can use in prompts to add formatting.
  For example, if you were to use a gen AI tool to copy-edit your work, you could surround text with “\_” to italicize it or “\*\*” to bold it.
  This preserves your formatting as you move it into a gen AI tool, which generally uses plain, or unformatted text.
